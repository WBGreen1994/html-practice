<p style="text-align:left;color:black;font-family:verdana;font-size:125%;">My name is Brent Green. I have lived in Texas for most of my life, but I have always enjoyed travelling and trying my hand new things. </p>
<pre style="text-align:left;color:black;font-family:verdana;font-size:125%;">
Most of my life you would find me behind some sort of power tool and not behind a keyboard.
But it seems the way the world is moving there will be more of a need for keyboard operating maintenance men rather than the
hammer and screwdriver weilding ones of yesterday. So welcome to my attempt at learning to code with html.
